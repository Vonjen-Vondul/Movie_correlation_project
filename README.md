## Overview

The Python script in this repository is designed to analyze movie data, with a focus on exploring movie budgets, gross earnings, and other related features. It uses libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data analysis and visualization.

## Data Source

The script loads movie data from a CSV file. The dataset contains various attributes of movies, including their budgets, gross earnings, release years, and more.

## Data Exploration

The script first loads the dataset and provides an initial overview. It checks for missing data in each column and displays the data types of the features. Missing data is handled by dropping rows with missing values.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning steps include standardizing the release year, sorting the dataset by gross earnings, and setting the display options to show all rows. The script also explores the correlation between the budget and gross earnings of movies.

## Data Visualization

The script creates visualizations to understand the relationship between budget and gross earnings. It includes scatter plots and regression plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Correlation Analysis

The script calculates and displays the correlation matrix for numeric features in the dataset. This analysis provides insights into the relationships between different attributes, such as budget, gross earnings, and more.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you have ideas for improving data analysis, visualizations, or any other enhancements, feel free to open an issue or create a pull request.

Feel free to explore the Python script and adapt it to your own movie data analysis needs. If you have any questions or need assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Enjoy analyzing movie data!
